Develop a tic-tac-toe game using arrays in C#. Have each player enter their move in a user-friendly interface.
Test if the position is valid and if not, ask the player to repeat the move. After each move, present the board with the
moves represented by "X" and "O" and check if any player won.
If there is a tie, display the result on the screen. Allow the game to restart without having to restart the game.


Extra challenge, may be worth some future activity: Implement a game against the computer. Do your best to prevent the player from winning against the computer.
To make it easier, make the computer start playing.
